LLM Chatbot
Nowadays, trained chatbots surround us in the form of LLMs like ChatGPT. Langchain is a programming framework around LLMs, for example for dialogue [1]. It provides tools for holding the conversation context in memory or accessing external data.

Interfacing with databases is straightforward, since the commercial LLMs are fluent with SQL and other data types, like with many programming languages. Upon your prompt, an LLM will easily generate a database of a desired format, empty or filled with phantasy data. Instructions about interfacing LLMs with databases are numerous, here is one using langchain [2]; here is another with an own database example [3]. One idea could be to interface the Menu of the Stellingen Cafeteria [4] using an RSS API, or, an LLM may just read the web-page like a human, to answer questions like "What are today's vegetarian choices?".
